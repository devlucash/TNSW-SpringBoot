The Problem:
Planning trips in NSW is challenging due to various issues that often result in suboptimal routing and trips with multiple modes of transport that have inaccurate buffer times. This complexity can make using public transport stressful.

The Solution (V1):
The initial solution utilizes PHP to allow users to create a custom trip planner. This planner includes additional buffer time between transport modes based on user preferences, reducing the stress associated with public transport.

Version 2:
The second version improves efficiency by reducing the number of API requests. This is achieved by introducing an SQL server to store data when requests are made. Currently, the SQL server is only hosted on the local computer and is not available online.
